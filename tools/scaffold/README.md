# Scaffold utilities

- `scaffold.sh`: one-shot script that generates the initial repo structure and helper scripts.
- `init-multicloud-oidc-repo.sh`: initializes/creates the GitHub repo and optional remote setup.

These are developer utilities (not cloud automation tools) and are kept here for reproducibility.
